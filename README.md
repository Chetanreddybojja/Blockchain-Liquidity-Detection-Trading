# Blockchain-Liquidity-Detection-Trading

This repository contains 2 of the earlier versions of my project. Viewers get a basic understanding of the working model.

This project leverages blockchain technology to enable efficient trading by detecting liquidity on the Ethereum network. Using custom servers, smart contracts, and system optimization techniques, this project can instantaneously call a pre-deployed smart contract with user-specified arguments upon detection of desired liquidity pool addition. Multiple systems concepts like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Database management have been extensively utilized to minimize latency across the board and optimize server workload.

## Installation

The markdown file server_setup.md details you how to set up the server from scratch and install a ETH/BSC full node.

app.js is the file to run on the server
